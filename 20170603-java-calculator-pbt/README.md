Calculator Kata
===============

The following is a Property-Based Testing Kata.

Create a simple Calculator with a method add(int a, int b). Use property-based testing to test the [addition mathematical properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#Properties): 

- Commutative property: Addition is commutative, one can change the order of operands, and the result is the same. 
- Associative property: When adding three or more numbers, the order of operations does not matter. 
- Identity property: When adding zero to any number, the quantity does not change; zero is the identity element for addition.

I created this kata inspired on this article [Property-based testing for Swift & Java. Part 1, Pedro Vicente Gómez Sánchez](http://blog.karumi.com/property-based-testing-part-1)
