Calculator Kata
===============

The following is a Property-Based Testing Kata.

Create a simple Calculator with a method add(int a, int b). Use property-based testing to test the [addition mathematical properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#Properties): 

- Commutative property: A binary operation is commutative if changing the order of the operands does not change the result.
- Associative property: Within an expression containing two or more occurrences in a row of the same associative operator, the order in which the operations are performed does not matter as long as the sequence of the operands is not changed.
- Identity property: An identity element or neutral element is a special type of element of a set with respect to a binary operation on that set, which leaves other elements unchanged when combined with them.

I created this kata inspired on this article [Property-based testing for Swift & Java. Part 1, Pedro Vicente Gómez Sánchez](http://blog.karumi.com/property-based-testing-part-1)
