# Pizza Delivery Kata

FEATURE: Pizza order online
As a pizza takeaway franchise owner
I want to accept online orders
In order to increase pizza sales

Story 1 - Create order
As a customer
I want to make a pizza order online
So that I do not have to make expensive and time-consuming phone calls

Story 2 - Order summary
As a customer
I want to review my order before submitting it
So that I can be sure I selected the right pizza and quantity

Story 3 - Generate order receipt
As a customer
I want a receipt by email for my order
So that I can keep track of my expenses

Story 4 - Confirmed orders are communicated to pizza makers
As a pizza maker
I want new orders to be handled and printed automatically
So that I can process them directly without wasting my time taking phone calls

Story 5 - Ready orders are communicated to delivery people
As a delivery man
I want to know when a order of pizzas is ready for delivery
So that I can collect it and deliver efficiently to the customer

Story 6 - Customer sign up
As a customer
I want the system to remember me
So that I won't need to introduce my personal details for every order

Other Considerations
- Pizzas can be ordered in three different sizes: small, medium or large.
- Customer must provide a delivery address.
