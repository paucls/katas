# Password Validator

Your job is to create a simple PasswordValidator to ensure that our users use strong passwords.

The rules for a valid password are as follows:

- Should be at least 8 characters long
- Contains a capital letter
- Contains a lowercase
- Contains a number
- Contains an underscore

This exercise shows the importance of:
- Selecting good examples
- Selecting the test order
- Having good assertions (testing only one thing and being always true)
